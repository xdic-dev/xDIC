# Summary <a name="Summary"></a>
MultiDIC (Multi Digital Image Correlation) is an open-source MATLAB toolbox by [Dana Solav](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/danask/). Three-dimensional (stereo) Digital Image Correlation (3D-DIC) is an important technique for measuring the mechanical behavior of materials. MultiDIC was developed to allow fast calibration even for a large number of cameras, and be easily adaptable to different experimental requirements. It integrates the 2D-DIC subset-based software [Ncorr](https://www.github.com/justinblaber/ncorr_2D_matlab) with several camera calibration algorithms to reconstruct 3D surfaces from multiple stereo image pairs. Moreover, it contains algorithms for merging multiple surfaces, and for computing and plotting displacement, deformation and strain measures. High-level scripts allow users to perform 3D-DIC analyses with minimal interaction with MATLAB syntax, while proficient MATLAB users can use stand-alone functions and data-structures to write custom scripts for specific experimental requirements. Comprehensive documentation, user guide, and sample data are included.
